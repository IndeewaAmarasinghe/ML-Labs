        "\n",
        "1. **Before modifying the fitness function, what was the optimal route and distance?**\n",
        "   - **Optimal Route:** `[0, 2, 4, 5, 3, 1, 0]`\n",
        "   - **Minimum Distance:** `115`\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **After including time constraints, how did the route change? Did the cost increase?**\n",
        "   - **New Optimal Route:** `[0, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 0]`\n",
        "   - **New Minimum Distance:** `165`\n",
        "   - The route changed from visiting locations 4 and 5 to prioritizing delivery based on preferred time slots. The total distance increased from `115` to `165` due to penalties for not adhering to the preferred delivery times.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **What happens when you increase the number of generations? What happens when you update the mutation rate, or change the size of the population? Briefly explain the observations.**\n",
        "   - **Increasing the Number of Generations:** This allows more exploration of the solution space, potentially leading to better optimization results. However, after a certain point, improvements may diminish as the algorithm converges.\n",
        "   - **Updating the Mutation Rate:** A higher mutation rate introduces more variability, helping to escape local optima, while a lower rate may lead to premature convergence. The right balance is crucial for effective optimization.\n",
        "   - **Changing the Size of the Population:** A larger population offers better diversity and exploration, potentially improving results but at the cost of increased computation. A smaller population can converge faster but risks getting stuck in local optima.\n",
        "\n",
        "These parameters are essential for balancing exploration and exploitation in a genetic algorithm, significantly impacting performance and optimization quality.\n"
